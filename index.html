                            I am the creator of this map and a senior at the College of Idaho, majoring in Math-Physics and Computer Science, minoring in Political Economy and Spanish. This project was an internship done in conjunction with the College of Idaho Spanish Department and the Basque Museum and Cultural Center. While making this site, I gained experience in organizing my workflow through GitHub, managing various branches of code, and making efficient modifications. I learned how to access documents through JavaScript on the webpage, letting it access the data for the cemetery. I can now navigate the organizational structure of Html, able to understand how the layout of the webpage comes to be. Finally, I gained experience in formatting the elements on the page through CSS, letting me make the map look decent.
