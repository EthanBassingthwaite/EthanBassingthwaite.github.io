          <p>
            I am Ethan Bassingthwaite, enjoyer of math, physics, computer science, and all around nerd. 
            I graduated Summa Cum Laude from the College of Idaho with a double major in Mathematics-Physics and Computer Science and minors in Political Economy, Professional Foundations, and Spanish.
            This website hosts various projects that I have done over the years and is being constantly improved.

              Magic the Gathering claims the crown as my largest hobby to date. I love the complexity and expression that it allows.

            <p>
              I love puzzles. A non-sequitar compared to the header, sure, but plans play to one's passions. 
              When researching Yellowballs, I found myself getting excited whenever a new bug was reported by team because it meant there was a 'why' for me to answer.
              Bugs provided me more than an opportunity to learn, a clear path to improve. More than just a way to pay the bills, I want a job where I face challenges which let me improve.
