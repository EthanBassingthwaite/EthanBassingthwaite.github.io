              I am Ethan Bassingthwaite, enjoyer of math, physics, computer science, and all around nerd. 
              I graduated Summa Cum Laude from the College of Idaho with a double major in Mathematics-Physics and Computer Science and minors in Political Economy, Professional Foundations, and Spanish.
              One of my proudest achievements is scoring 14/120 on the Putnam Exam, in part because it is a worthy accomplishment and because without context it sounds terrible.
              The Putnam exam is an advanced mathematics exam for undergraduates where students spend 6-7 hours on a Saturday proving various mathematics problems during finals week.
              It consists of 12 questions split over 2 parts, with each question being worth 10 points each. 
              Despite the abundance of obtainable points, the median score is 0. Over half of all participants get nothing. 
              My score of 14 puts me in the top 20% of participants.
              In addition, I found the test extremely enjoyable because of the emphasis on proving the result rather than just providing the result.
              To me, proofs just feel more satisfying. 
              Like developing formulas for physical phenomena or creating code that will work for all future instances, rather than a single solution from experiments or code written to solve specifically one issue.

              This website hosts various projects that I have done over the years and is constantly being improved. 
              Keep an eye out for my next addition, which will feature the Jellyfish Diagram independent study.

                I love reading fantasy, and adore the stories that contain unique magic systems. 
                Brandon Sanderson may be one of the prominent authors in this regard and has written some of my favorite books.
                He manages to write magic systems that feel like an extension of physics where each magic system fits together perfectly and obeys clear rules.
                Yet from those constraining rules, creativity is born, like how drawing a line between two points is more enjoyable when there is a maze between them.
                I must admit that my love of coding, math, and physics likely originates from such constrained creativity.
                Not mentioning math and physics, in coding we are limited by the technology we work with and must make solutions regardless.
                This makes finding an answer all the more satisfying and has been a driving force behind my passion.

                Outside of reading, Magic the Gathering claims the crown as my largest hobby to date. 
                I love the complexity and expression that it allows, especially in the Commander/EDH format.
                In EDH, one must build a deck consisting of 100 cards that are all unique, which alongside the limited card pool available creates the constrained creativity I desire.
                For instance, my favorite deck features Kadena as its leader and functions around morph creatures, which are unknown to all players except their owner until they reveal themselves with a dastardly surprise.
                It flips the play pattern on its head, which is my favorite thing to do in games.
                I want to approach a game from a different angle than the usual and expected one. 
                By doing so, I am able to get a fresh perspective and do stuff that would be otherwise out of reach. 
                I figure that such an approach is applicable beyond games as well; out of the box approaches are the precursor to innovation.
                Which is why when approaching a problem, I like to at minimum consider alternative methods to avoid missing out on an ingenious solution.

              I love puzzles. 
              A non-sequitar compared to the header, sure, but plans play to passions. 
              When researching Yellowballs, I found myself getting excited whenever a new bug was reported by team because it meant there was a 'why' for me to answer.
              Bugs provided me more than an opportunity to learn, a clear path to improve. 
              More than just a way to pay the bills, I want a job where I face challenges which let me improve.
