                            I am Ethan Bassingthwaite, enjoyer of math, physics, computer science, and all around nerd. 
                            I graduated Summa Cum Laude from the College of Idaho with a double major in Mathematics-Physics and Computer Science and minors in Political Economy, Professional Foundations, and Spanish.
                            This website hosts various projects that I have done over the years and is being constantly improved.
