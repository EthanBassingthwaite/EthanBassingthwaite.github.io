                    I created this map as my very first foray into web development as part of a project with the Basque Museum and Cultural Center in Boise, Idaho. 
                    The goal was to make the data gathered in the Jordan Valley Cemetery more accessible through a map that the users could interact with. 
                    My personal goal was to have the map be intuitive - the search results can be resized and clicking on the search results opens the point on the map.   

                    My personal thanks to researchers, such as Dr. Bonmatí (CofI), Patty Miller and Megan Overgaard, who collected data from the cemetery that made this project possible.

                    This map was designed to be flexible. 
                    One can easily insert it into practically any website with ease akin to a simple image. 
                    In addition, it draws all its data from a csv file, which means one can make minor modifications, swap out the data, and have a map for another cemetery. 
                    The Basque Museum and Cultural Center hopes to use and expand this code to map out other cemeteries. For instance, it would take only the following steps: 
                </p>
                    <ol style="margin: 5px 0px 0px 45px;">
                        <li>Upload a new CSV file following the same naming conventions </li>
                         <li>Insert the div element “MapContainer” and its contents where you want the map to go (along with copying over the relevant files and dependencies) </li>
                        <li>Modify a few aspects of the code, such as starting position of the map or size of the MapContainer </li>
                    </ol>
                <p style="color: #222; margin:0px 20px;">
                    The code can be accessed <a href="https://github.com/EthanBassingthwaite/EthanBassingthwaite.github.io">here</a>
